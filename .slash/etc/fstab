# The first field, (fs_spec), describes the block special device, the local filesystem, or the remote filesystem to be mounted.
# The second field, (fs_file), describes the mount point for the filesystem.
# The third field, (fs_vfstype), describes the type of the filesystem.
# The fourth field, (fs_mntops), describes the mount options associated with the filesystem.
# The fifth field, (fs_freq), is used for these filesystems by the dump(8) command to determine which filesystems need to be dumped.
# The sixth field, (fs_passno), is used by the fsck(8) program to determine the order in which filesystem checks are done at reboot time.
